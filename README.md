# CancerControl_AI_ECS_Matrix
Precision oncology system integrating ECS, quantum, miRNA, and AI-tuned PCD triggers — for clinical, research, or SaaS deployment.
This repository contains the framework, datasets, and tactical overlays for a multi-hallmark, multi-PCD oncology kill system. Designed as a clinical-grade weapon against all known cancer resistance mechanisms, this system integrates:

- 🔬 20 Reprogrammed Hallmarks of Cancer
- 💀 41 Programmed Cell Death Pathways
- 🧬 miRNA, GPCR, ECS & Ion Channel Modulation Points
- ⚡ Quantum Bioelectric Disruption Models
- 🧠 AI-ready therapeutic logic & clinical formulation pathways
